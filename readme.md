####Sublime Text 2 - my user settings

These are my settings for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).


I created this repo in order to backup the settings easily and able to clone / fork between my working various operating systems. But if you like to have them in your settings, you're welcome. Feel free to clone or fork. :)
